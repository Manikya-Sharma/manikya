# My portfolio website

This is the source code of my portfolio website.

## Tech Stack

1. [Astro](https://astro.build/) with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)
2. Animations using [anime.js](https://animejs.com/)
3. CSS styling using [tailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [daisyui](https://daisyui.com/)
4. Email notifications using [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/)
5. Deployment and remote functions using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

## Aim

The aim of this portfolio is to be as performant as possible along with best accessibility practices. 
There is an extra focus on usability by using proper contrasts and micro-animations for instant feedback.
Significant effort has been put to ensure maximum ease of use with screen readers and keyboard animation. 

## Inspiration

1. A large number of websites that I found on [awwwards](www.awwwards.com/)
2. AnimeJS webstie for cool spring animations

## Scope for improvement

- [ ] Projects page and Contacts page should be made more accessible if JS doesn't load on client device.
- [ ] Use svelte to its full potential, might not even need to use AnimeJS.
- [ ] Should create different sections for varying domains such as frontend, backend or research.
- [ ] Describe more about yourself.
- [ ] Maybe start writing blogs?
